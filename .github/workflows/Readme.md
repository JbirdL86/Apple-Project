# Apple

> This is a Microverse project for students. It involves the use of several positioning techniques like float, position absolute, 
position relative, grid, flex. It also invlolves the use of linear gradients and background images. For the navbar I used a linear
gradient with the default "to bottom" direction setting and started it with a dark gray. I also used two "color-stops" with the same 
percentage in order to make it look like two solid colors pusshing each other.
